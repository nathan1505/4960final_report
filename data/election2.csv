Carbon Tax ,Liberal ,impose,0.5,"The Liberals set a minimum carbon price of $20 per tonne this year, increasing $10 a year to $50 by 2022, and imposed a carbon tax on businesses and individuals in provinces with no federally approved carbon price plan. In those provinces, Ottawa is handing back carbon tax rebates to most residents. The tax has faced unsuccessful court challenges from several provinces."
Carbon Tax ,Conservative ,impose,-1,"Conservatives have called the Liberals’ carbon tax ineffective and have vowed to repeal it. The party would leave it to the provinces to decide if they want to put a price on carbon. It promises to reduce carbon emissions by investing in green technology funded in part by polluters who fail to meet new standards, but haven’t explained how this would be more effective than a carbon tax."
Carbon Tax ,New Democrat ,impose,1,"New Democrats are in favour of continuing with a carbon tax and the rebate program. However, Leader Jagmeet Singh wants to crack down more on heavy emitters. He said he wants those who produce the most emissions to “have the most burden” and vows to change the requirements slightly for industrial emitters."
Carbon Tax ,Bloc Québécois ,impose,1,The Bloc is in favour of a carbon tax but argues the Liberal plan doesn’t go far enough. It wants a tax of $30 per tonne on greenhouse gases in provinces where emissions per capita are higher than average. This would increase to $200 per tonne by 2030. The charge wouldn’t apply in “greener” provinces like Quebec.
Carbon Tax ,Green ,impose,0.5,"Leader Elizabeth May supports the carbon tax, saying putting a price on carbon has been “one of the cornerstones of Green Party climate policy for many years.” But she said it alone is not sufficient to meet the emissions targets of the Paris Accord, a target she hopes to double."
Carbon Tax ,People's Party ,impose,-1,"The People’s Party plans to get rid of the carbon tax, citing an increased cost for business and the threat of job losses. Instead, it plans to allow provinces to reduce emissions through their own programs “if they want to.”"

Child Care,Conservative ,child benefit,0.5,"The party has pledged to maintain Liberal initiatives — it would continue with the Canada Child Benefit and increase social transfer payments by at least three per cent every year, which helps provinces and territories finance childcare and early learning. Leader Andrew Scheer made a new promise to make Employment Insurance benefits for new parents tax-free."
Child Care,New Democrat ,child benefit,1,"New Democrats would commit $1 billion to affordable, not-for-profit child care in 2020 and increase that amount yearly.

The party wants to implement a national school nutrition program."
Child Care,Bloc Québécois ,child benefit,0,The party has not released a policy on this issue. That’s likely because it’s not really an issue in Quebec; the province already has its own extensive subsidized child-care program.
Child Care,Green ,child benefit,1,"The party would boost child-care funding to at least one per cent of GDP annually. This would fund a universal child-care program, with an emphasis on creating child-care spaces in workplaces. Greens would remove the GST from the cost of building new child-care spaces.

The party proposes a tax credit for recent graduates or immigrants who move to rural areas for jobs and wants responsibility of the temporary foreign worker program transferred to Quebec.
Jobs,Green ,immigrant workers assistant ,1,"The party wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and ban unpaid internships that aren’t for school credits. It wants to cancel the temporary foreign worker program and implement a guaranteed livable income. The party has also proposed a robot tax, which would force companies to pay a tax when they replace an employee with a machine."

Manufacturing,Liberal ,innovation funding,1,Liberals handed out chunks of the $1.33 billion they raised from retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. to the steel and aluminium sectors across Canada.

NAFTA,Liberal ,new deal,1,"Liberals gave up some concessions on greater access to Canadian dairy, chicken and egg markets, but were ultimately able to strike a new NAFTA deal with the U.S., something they are very proud of. But it has yet to be ratified by U.S. lawmakers. Liberals know the deal is not perfect, but don’t want to reopen it for fear of losing aspects of the deal they fought hard to keep."
NAFTA,Conservative ,new deal,-1,"Conservatives were quick to criticize the Liberals when they struck the deal, arguing it was worse for Canadians than the old one. They specifically complained about its impact on softwood lumber and dairy. They’ve even released attack ads on it. But if elected, they wouldn’t re-open the agreement."
NAFTA,New Democrat ,new deal,-0.5,"New Democrats don’t think the deal is good enough for Canadians. They are in favour of changes and hope they can be approved by the U.S. Congress. They are worried about increased drug costs, a concern they share with Democrats in the U.S."
NAFTA,Bloc Québécois ,new deal,-1,To say the Bloc were upset with the new deal would be an understatement; the party called it the “worst possible agreement.” It was outraged by the impact on supply management and accused Liberals of using Quebec’s dairy farmers as a “bargaining chip.” The party wants to introduce a bill to prevent cuts to supply management in future talks.
NAFTA,Green ,new deal,0.5,"Leader Elizabeth May has called for NAFTA renegotiations for some time — it was a key theme of her speech when she won her party’s leadership in 2006. She congratulated the negotiation team for striking a new deal. However, she said she feels torn by some aspects of it and worries about its impact on supply management and drug costs."
NAFTA,People's Party ,new deal,-1.5,Leader Maxime Bernier criticized the negotiation team for acting like “amateurs.” He said he was happy to see supply management come up during the negotiations but was disappointed that it wasn’t eradicated entirely.
Pipelines,Liberal ,new pipeline project,0.5,"For Liberals and pipelines, it’s pick and choose. They support Line 3, Keystone XL, the massive LNG project running to B.C.’s coast and the Trans Mountain pipeline extension, which they bought for $4.5 billion. But they cancelled the Northern Gateway pipeline and changed the rules for the Energy East pipeline, leading to the project’s abandonment."
Pipelines,Conservative ,new pipeline project,1,"The Conservatives want to expand Canada’s oil and gas sector and have accused Liberals of stalling Trans Mountain. Leader Andrew Scheer said he would use constitutional powers to declare construction of pipelines to be in the national interest, a move he argues would get them built faster. He also would overturn recent legislation restricting the movement of oil tankers in northern B.C."
Pipelines,New Democrat ,new pipeline project,-1,"Leader Jagmeet Singh has strongly opposed the Trans Mountain project. But his reversal over the liquefied natural gas project in B.C. has drawn ridicule. He previously supported the project, but backed down in May. He still won’t say whether he supports it, telling reporters the future of energy does not include fracking or fossil fuels. He would give provinces veto power over national infrastructure projects that run through them, including pipelines."
Pipelines,Bloc Québécois ,new pipeline project,-1,"The party is against new pipelines — especially Energy East, the proposed pipeline that would have run through Quebec. TransCanada cancelled it in 2017, after stiff protests and a federal change in the approval process. It wants Quebec to have a veto over any pipeline that would run through the province and for the government to sell off Trans Mountain."
Pipelines,Green ,new pipeline project,-1,"Leader Elizabeth May would not approve any new pipeline project and opposes any pipeline carrying diluted bitumen. She would also cancel Trans Mountain — and was even arrested while protesting the project. Her party wants Canada off oil by 2050. Until then, the party wants to stop imports of foreign oil."
Pipelines,People's Party ,new pipeline project,1,"The party strongly supports building pipelines and, like the Conservatives, would use constitutional powers to declare pipeline building to be in the national interest. Leader Maxime Bernier has said he would be willing to use the Constitution to “impose a pipeline in [his] own province of Quebec” — a move many Quebec politicians reject."

They also want to adjust the Criminal Code with new penalties for elder abuse and to collect better data on how widespread it is.
Seniors,Conservative ,Increase Old Age Security (OAS),0.5,"The party has promised to increase the Age Tax Credit by $1,000, available to seniors making less than $87,750.
